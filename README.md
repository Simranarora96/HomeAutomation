# HomeAutomation

IoT project under the home mechanization sector. The designed device is deployed on doors, windows, cupboards or any other
opening to give you an incursion alert alongwith device to control traditional wall switches remotely.

● The hardware has been developed using BLE-SoC microcontroller (Dialog Semiconductor- DA14580) which employs Bluetooth and internet to connect to the user and provide alert using SMS or a phone call in case of intrusion.
● The BLE-SoC microcontroller coupled with relays to control light switches over BLE and wifi through the central hub.
● A network of central hubs connected to all the other nodes or sensors positioned at different locations in a home.
● The user uses the android application to monitor its connected devices and congruently control their settings remotely.
● A smart gateway is assimilated to provide a secure communication channel between user and the hub.
● The prototype developed has a lifespan of 3 to 4 years surviving on a coin cell battery and costing less than 50 USD.
